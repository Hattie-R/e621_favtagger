# E621 Favourites

This software goes through photos, searches for them on e621 and adds them to your e621 account favourites.
In the end, the programm will replace the existed files with the best resolution from e621 and sort files to two folders. First folder is what It managed to find on e621, and the second one is for files it couldn't find.
For this program to use, you are required to have an e621 account, where you can generate API key.

### How to get API key
Go to Account → Manage API Access → Insert your password → Copy the API key on the left column.

### Known Issues:

♦ It is slow.

♦ It cannot work with subfolders.

♦ It cannot look for videos and animated GIFs.

♦ It says success for deleted from e621 files, and then deletes the file itself on the sortation procedure.
